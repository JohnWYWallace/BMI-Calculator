# BMI Calculator

## End Goal

This project demonstrates the use of Optionals and shows the use of the MVC design pattern. Compares objects created from classes with instances of Structs.

## What was created

The end goal of this project is a Body Mass Index Calculator based upon the userâ€™s height and weight. After the user inputs their height and weight, the user will tap on calculate and a screen will pop up with a small health advice message as well as a custom color indicating whether they are in good health or not. Green being good health, red being overweight, and blue being underweight.

## What I learned from this project

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* Optional binding, chaining, and the nil coalescing operator.
* Creating classes and the difference between classes and structs.
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference.
* Formatting strings.
* Color literals.
